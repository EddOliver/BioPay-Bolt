Thank you for your interest in contributing to BioPay! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm or yarn
- Git
- Expo CLI
- Basic knowledge of React Native and TypeScript

### Development Setup

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/biopay.git
   cd biopay
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style and formatting
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

### File Organization

- Place reusable components in `/components`
- Place screens in `/app` following Expo Router conventions
- Place utilities in `/utils`
- Place types in `/types`
- Place stores in `/stores`

### Naming Conventions

- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `WalletSetup.tsx`)
- **Files**: camelCase for utilities, PascalCase for components
- **Variables**: camelCase
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- **Types/Interfaces**: PascalCase with descriptive names

## üîß Technical Guidelines

### React Native Best Practices

- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use StyleSheet.create for styling
- Optimize performance with useMemo and useCallback when needed
- Handle platform differences appropriately

### State Management

- Use Zustand for global state
- Keep state as minimal as possible
- Use local state for component-specific data
- Implement proper loading and error states

### Algorand Integration

- Use the official Algorand SDK (algosdk)
- Handle network errors gracefully
- Implement proper transaction validation
- Never expose private keys or mnemonics
- Use TestNet for development and testing

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for utilities and pure functions
- Write integration tests for complex workflows
- Test error scenarios and edge cases
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
