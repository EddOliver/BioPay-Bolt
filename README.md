## BioPay Buildup!

Bolt.new buildup!

We first came across Bolt.new through the hackathon as my team and I are avid hackathoners. Then we decided to solve for that problem that was very difficult for us at that moment. Then the app we decided to create was planned accordingly.


We decided to code a web dapp with Expo that uses AI to create an identity platform that uses face identification for said platform and payments to empower the onboarding of new users that we think is the main problem of crypto at the moment.

The application would have first a login screen to set up your Algorand wallet, then a structure of three tabs with their respective screens. A home screen for your digital assets including USDC and most of the most important algorand-based tokens. Another screen would be the "Charge" one, which would have three buttons, one to pay with an algorand address, another one for the QR, and the last one to do face payments, with their respective screens also for each button for the face payment try not to develop it as much as I will connect an AI service to it. The last screen would be the identity platform based on Face-identification, with perks and a reward system as part of this proof of humanity network that we are building, in addition to a button to onboard users to the Face Identification network.

For the AI-face identification portion we would have to store a GPU enabled algorithmic system in a GPU-based server and hard-code that part as it is an additional system on top of the one we would do in bolt.

For the Bolt portion we would create the whole application, UI/UX, and even the Algorand SDK and smart contract inputs. 

Because of that, we consumed almost any documentation available, workshops and videos on how to prompt better in Bolt.new. This proved to be very successful for us as the first approach of the application ran correctly with this prompt:

We added then a couple adjustments to it:

And finally added the Algorand SDK and kits available that proved to be quite difficult to integrate into this Expo version but after several tries and error corrections by Bolt we were able to get running.

Finally we added the Badges to qualify it to the Hackathon.
